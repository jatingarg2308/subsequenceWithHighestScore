# Subsequence With Highest Score

# Adding sample File
1. Create a test file name temp.txt where random characters of 3 gb are stored
2. temp.txt file should be stored in the location where Calculation.py is kept
3. From Main file run the program

# Changing the size of the file
If the size of the file is changed then:
1. Find the number of characters possible in that file
3. Change the while loop condition in Calculation.py to the solution you got in above 2 steps

# Change the Subsequence Length
In Calculation.py change the variable max_subsequence_size to the desired value
